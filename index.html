		  <b>On a high cliff over Lake Noen lie the ruins of count Per Brahe the Younger’s hunting castle Brahälla.</b> <br>
This was Per Brahe’s last building project within the county of Visingsborg before his death in 1680. The following year, the Crown revoked the Brahe family’s properties, among them Näs seat farm, on whose land Brahälla was built. The hunting castle was completed in a couple of years. The walls were constructed in the summer of 1680, and the roof shingles were laid in 1681. <br><br>
<b>The rendered façade was in a red colour from the start.</b> It was hardly a hunting castle in the true sense of the word. T he scale was modest, with a basement, great hall, foyer and chamber. Just like the more impressive Brahehus, the high roof had a balcony, allowing visitors to enjoy the expansive views. Per Brahe liked to choose dramatic and scenic locations for his luxury castles “for the sake of the Prospects”, as he himself wrote. Brahälla was probably never used to any extent. After 1681, the seat farm passed through several noble families. <br><br>
<b>In the late 18th century, </b>tiles were stolen from the building, and in the 19th century, the roof blew off. After that, the Brahälla Castle soon went into disrepair. Different images from the 19th century illustrate the decaying process of the building and how the walls gradually fell. The ruins were restored in the 1930s, and parts of the fallen walls were rebuilt. Sods of grass were placed on top of the walls as protection. The latest preservation measures were carried out in 2010.
